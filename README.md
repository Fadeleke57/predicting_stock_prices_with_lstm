# Predicting Next-Day Prices with LSTM Model

### (To be integrated with Bonsai Finance architecture)

## Description
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict next-day stock prices. It utilizes data acquired from Alpha Vantage stock APIs and employs PyTorch for data preparation, model definition, training, evaluation, and prediction along with Matplotlib to display the data.

## Process
1. Installing Python Dependencies: Setting up the required libraries and frameworks for data processing and machine learning.
2. Data Preparation - Acquiring Data: Fetching stock price data from Alpha Vantage stock APIs.
3. Data Preparation - Normalizing Raw Data: Processing the raw data to a format suitable for the LSTM model, including normalization.
4. Data Preparation - Generating Datasets: Creating training and validation datasets necessary for training the LSTM model.
5. Defining the LSTM Model: Architecting the LSTM model tailored for stock price prediction.
6. Model Training: Training the LSTM model on the prepared datasets.
7. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model based on various metrics.
8. Predicting Future Stock Prices: Utilizing the trained model to forecast next-day stock prices.
